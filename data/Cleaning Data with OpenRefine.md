Cleaning Data with OpenRefine [#/cleaning-data-with-openrefine?id=cleaning-data-with-openrefine] [https://youtu.be/zxEtfHseE84] This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies: Data Upload and Project Creation : Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis. Faceting Data : Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs. Clustering Methodology : Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation. Manual and Automated Clustering : Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system’s clustering accuracy. Entity Resolution : Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
