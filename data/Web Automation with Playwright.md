[https://youtu.be/biFzRHk4xpY] ( youtube.com [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biFzRHk4xpY&utm_source=chatgpt.com] ) Playwright offers: JavaScript rendering : Executes page scripts so you scrape only after content appears. ( playwright.dev [https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro] ) Headless & headed modes : Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. ( playwright.dev [https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro] ) Auto‑waiting & retry : Built‑in locators reduce flakiness. ( playwright.dev [https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators] ) Multi‑browser support : Chromium, Firefox, WebKit—all from one API. ( playwright.dev [https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro] ) Example: Scraping a JS‑Rendered Site [#/web-automation-with-playwright?id=example-scraping-a-jsrendered-site] We’ll scrape Quotes to Scrape (JS) [https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/] —a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple requests call gets only an empty shell ( quotes.toscrape.com [https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/] ). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content: # /// script
# dependencies = ["playwright"]
# ///

from playwright . sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_quotes ( ) :
with sync_playwright ( ) as p :
# Channel can be "chrome", "msedge", "chrome-beta", "msedge-beta" or "msedge-dev".
browser = p . chromium . launch ( headless = True , channel = "chrome" )
page = browser . new_page ( )
page . goto ( "https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/" )
quotes = page . query_selector_all ( ".quote" )
for q in quotes :
text = q . query_selector ( ".text" ) . inner_text ( )
author = q . query_selector ( ".author" ) . inner_text ( )
print ( f" { text } — { author } " )
browser . close ( )

if __name__ == "__main__" :
scrape_quotes ( ) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Save as scraper.py and run: uv run scraper.py Copy to clipboard Error Copied You’ll see each quote plus author printed—fetched only after the JS executes.
